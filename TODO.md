 # TODO!

 ## Timeline
 
 In short we want an initial prototype working by the end of this week 3/11/2024.

 As discussed in the GRID we will divide into design and script teams:
 - Design: Jack, Liam and Sean.
 - Script: Tony, Dimitris

 ## Design

 Design team will be responsible mostly for creating HTML and CSS... the core
 structure of the website.

 ## Script

 Script will implement DB schema, DB communication, serving databseinformation to 
 the front end via a simple API and implementation of site functionality (frontend JS).
